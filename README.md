# TIMProject
This is the repository for TIM Project 

In our project we decide to don't use any templete,we just use bootstrap as a framework so we could use some useful function.
The website follow the p-idm schema and is  similar to the mock up. We implement 2 different menu,one for the mobile and one for the normal version of the website.
We develop all the website except for some parts of the category of service.
In the category of device all the category are navigable,and all the device have some services,some assistance service,their personal description and technical characteristics,and each one has the associated form to buy it(the fist devices has more service than the others). We do the same for the assistance service while for category of service we develop tv & entertainment in particoular we develop interly tim-reading,tv and tim games. The other category are not navigable so we make them as static html pages.
